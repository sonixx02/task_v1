ER Diagram Overview
This diagram will show the key entities involved: Users, Admin (Brand), Routines, Progress, and how they relate to each other.

Here’s a textual representation of how we can visualize the entities and their relationships:

Entities:
User:

Attributes: userId, name, email, password, age, gender, preferences (e.g., fitness, wellness), createdAt
Relations: A User can start multiple Routines. They track their Progress for each Routine.
Admin (Brand):

Attributes: adminId, email, password
Relations: An Admin can create and manage Routines.
Routine:

Attributes: routineId, name, duration, steps (e.g., instructions like "apply almond oil"), milestones, benefits, createdBy (adminId)
Relations: A Routine can have multiple Progress records (one for each User), and it is created by an Admin.
Progress:

Attributes: progressId, userId, routineId, completedWeeks (e.g., [1, 2, 3]), achievedBenefits (e.g., "Week 1: Improved hydration"), remindersSent, lastUpdated
Relations: A Progress record is specific to a User and a Routine. It tracks how many weeks have been completed and the benefits achieved.

Explanation:
Admin can create routines and manage them.

Admin adds routines (e.g., "8-week Hair Care Routine").
Admin also creates steps for each routine (e.g., "Apply shampoo", "Apply conditioner", etc.) and defines milestones and benefits (e.g., "Week 1: Improved scalp health").
User can:

Start a routine: Users can start routines created by Admin (brands).
Track progress: Users can see their progress and how many weeks they’ve completed, along with the benefits they have achieved.
Complete weekly steps: As users progress through the routine, they mark weeks as completed.
Receive reminders: The app will send reminders to users to stay on track with their routine and milestones.
Routine contains the details of what a user needs to follow for each week.

Each Routine has a specific duration (e.g., 8 weeks) and multiple steps. The steps could include actions beyond product usage (e.g., "Apply almond oil after wash").
Routine also has milestones and weekly benefits to encourage users.
Progress is tracked for each User on a specific Routine.

Progress stores details about which weeks the user has completed, the benefits achieved (e.g., "Week 1: Hydration"), and whether reminders have been sent.
Admin (Brand) Role:
Can create, update, and delete routines.
Can view all routines created by them.
Can manage steps and benefits for each routine.
Provides analytics on routine engagement (e.g., number of completions).
User Role:
Can view and start routines.
Can track progress (week-by-week milestones and benefits).
Can receive reminders and notifications for completing steps and milestones.
Can mark progress (e.g., Week 1 completed, benefits achieved).
What Each Code Does:
Routine Controller (Admin side):
Allows the Admin to create, update, delete, and view routines.
Allows the Admin to manage routine steps and weekly benefits.
Progress Controller (User side):
Allows the User to start a routine.
Allows the User to update progress by completing weeks.
Allows the User to view progress for each routine.
Database Relations:
A User can have multiple Progress records (one for each Routine they are following).
A Routine can have multiple Progress records (one for each User enrolled in it).
Workflow for Admin:
Admin creates routines with steps, benefits, and milestones.
Admin can view all routines and analyze routine engagement.
Workflow for User:
User logs in and chooses a routine to start.
User tracks progress, marks weeks as completed, and sees weekly benefits.
User receives reminders to complete steps for the routine.
Summary:
Admin has control over creating and managing routines, steps, and benefits.
User interacts with routines, tracks their progress, and receives reminders for completion.
Progress stores the completion status for users on each routine.
